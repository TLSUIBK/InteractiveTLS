# Interactive TLS

This code is an interactive learning platform for the **transport Layer Security (TLS)  Protocol**'s handhake, version 1.3.


Two tools are available:

 1.  *TLS Handshake:* Discover how the TLS protocol works by visualising and interactively playing with the fields and steps of the protocol
 2. *Attacks:* Discover possible attacks (downgrade and replay) in TLS by visualising them with animation.
