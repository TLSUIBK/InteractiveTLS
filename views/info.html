	<p> This website is an interactive learning platform for the transport layer security (TLS) protocol's handhake, version 1.3. It is intended for educational purposes. </p>
	<p> Two tools are available: 
		<ul>
			<li><b>TLS Handshake</b>: Discover how the TLS protocol works by visualising and interactively playing with the fields and steps of the protocol</li>
			<li><b>Attacks</b>: Discover possible attacks (downgrade and replay) in TLS by visualising them with animation.</li>
		</ul>

	<h1>1. TLS Handshake</h1>
	<p>This tool helps the user to play around the protocol and discover each field and step of the protocol. </p>
	The TLS Handshake sub-protocol can be divided into three phases (key exchange, server parameters, and authentication), where each phase has many steps and each step has many fields.
	The three phases (key exchange, server parameters, and authentication) are represented by the three colors: <span style="color:#2E86C1">Blue</span>, <span style="color:#F39C12"> Orange </span>, and  <span style="color:#16A085">Green </span> respectively.
	Each step is represented by a bubble that contains field x and y, like the following example:
	<div class="stepClient" >
    <div class="stepClientContent" id="keyExchange" >    
    	<h3> Step's title (Key Exchange phase)</h3>
    	<div style="display: inline-block;" >
            <div class="deleteButton" >x</div>
            <div class="adjustButton" >+</div>
            <div class="infoButton" >i</div>
            field x
        </div>
        </br>
        <div style="display: inline-block;" >
            <div class="deleteButton" >x</div>
            <div class="adjustButton" >+</div>
            <div class="infoButton" >i</div>
            field y
        </div>
        </br>
    </div>
	</div>
	<br/>
	Where: <br/>

	<div class="infoButton" >i</div> Info Button: Gives information about the field <br/>

	<div class="adjustButton" >+</div> Adjust Button: Let the user adjust the field's value <br/>

	<div class="deleteButton" >x</div> Delete Button: Deletes the field from the step

	<br/>
	<br/>
	<h3> <u><b>Blocked Step: </b></u></h3>
	When the step has a grey background, this means that the step is not yet done. The blocking of a step can be due to:
	<ul>
		<li> Normal reasons: the user did not yet arrive to the step </li>
		<li> Alert: blocking of the step because of an alert that was triggered from a step preceding it. </li>
	</ul>
	<div class="stepClient" >
    <div class="stepClientContent" id="keyExchange" style="background-color:#E5E7E9">    
    	<h3> Step's title</h3>
    	<div style="display: inline-block;" >
            <div class="infoButton" >i</div>
            field x
        </div>
        </br>
        <div style="display: inline-block;" >
            <div class="infoButton" >i</div>
            field y
        </div>
        </br>
    </div>
	</div>
	<br/>

	<h3> <u><b>Alert: </b></u></h3>
	<p>When an alert is triggered, the handshake is aborted. Therefore the tool will go back to the step where the alert was triggered and block all the steps following it.</p>
	<p> To unblock the steps that were blocked due to an alert, the alert must be resolved. </p>

	<h3> <u><b>Challenger: </b></u></h3>
	<p>The challenger is here to help you get familiar with the platform.</p>
	<ul>
	<li>	To start a challenge:
		<ul>
			<li> Accept the challenge by clickin on   <button  id="addButton" style="background-color: green; color:white; margin:10px;" >Challenge Accepted</button> </li>
			<li>  "<span style="color:#1F618D;">Challenge Accepted</span>" will show. </li>
			<li> Try to solve the challenge </li>
			<li> If lost, click on <button style="border-color: transparent; font-size:10px">Lost and need the answer? Click here</button> to see hints on how to solve it</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li> To Change a challenge, reshuffle by clicking on:  <span> &#8635; </span>
